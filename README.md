# üì¶ Installation

## ‚ö° Require installed

- Docker, docker-compose ...
- Or custom install:
  * Nodejs: [nodejs 18](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce)
  * Package Manager: [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  * Message Broker: [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
  * Database: [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [replica set mode](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/) or [mongodb atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/)
  * Cache: [Redis](https://redis.io/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows subsystems for Linux) is **recommended** for both development and production
- Windows is **not** recommended, can use in development **not** for production

## üìù Before start

- Copy the .env.example and rename to .env.
- Change the default values to your own.

## üê≥ With docker, docker-compose

### üî® Services
- Core services:
  * Database
  * Message Broker
  * Reverse proxy
- Application services (each folder in `apps` folder is a service):
  * api
  * auth
  * search
  * .etc..

### Starting

#### First, you need to start the core services
```bash
yarn up:core # start core services
```

#### Then, you can start the application services
- `service_name` - optional: is the name of the service you want to start, by default it will start all services
```bash
yarn up:prod <service_name> # start all services in production mode
```

### Stopping
- `service_name` - optional: is the name of the service you want to start, by default it will start all services
```bash
yarn down:prod <service_name>  # stop all services
# or
yarn down:core # stop core services
```

### Restart and rebuild
- `service_name` - optional: is the name of the service you want to start, by default it will start all services
```bash
yarn restart:prod <service_name> # restart and rebuild all services 
# or
yarn restart:core # restart and rebuild core services
```

### Update the services
- `service_name` - optional: is the name of the service you want to start, by default it will start all services
- Update the services to the latest version from the docker registry
- Make sure your github repository is up to date
```bash
git pull # update the repository

yarn update:prod <service_name> # update core services
```

## ü¶Ω With manual run

### Required
- Make sure all the following core services have been installed and run successfully
  * RabbitMQ: port 5672
  * Mongodb: port 27017, replica set mode
  * Redis: port 6379
- Or you can run core services in docker and run app services manually
- Or you can using cloud services like [mongodb atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), [redis cloud](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/), [rabbitmq cloud](https://www.cloudamqp.com/)

### Starting
- `service_name` - optional: is the name of the service you want to start, by default it is `api` service
```bash
# You can run core services in docker and run app services manually

yarn start <service_name> # start the service as normal mode
yarn start:dev <service_name> # start the service as development mode
yarn start:prod <service_name> # start the service as production mode
```

### Stopping
```bash
# Just CTRL-C to stop the service
```

### Use Docker

- Check what is running on docker:
```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Get the log of a container:
```bash
docker logs <CONTAINER_ID> # get logs

docker logs -f <CONTAINER_ID> # get logs realtime
# Remember to replace `<CONTAINER_ID>` with the actual ID of the container you want to inspect.
```

- To remove all containers, volumes, and images that are not currently running, you can use the following commands:
```bash
docker container prune # remove all stopped containers
docker volume prune # remove all unused volumes
docker image prune # remove all unused images
# or just one
docker system prune -a # remove all stopped containers and unused volumes, images
```
